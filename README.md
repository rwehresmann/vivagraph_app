# Description

This is a sample app using **vivagraph** javascript library. You can find from basic implementations (like graph generation) to more elaborated stuffs (like add a link between two nodes in runtime) here. Take a look on [this animation](http://imgur.com/a/oyeAZ).

## Usage

Ruby on Rails is used as back-end, so make sure to have it installed.

In your terminal, run:

* `bundle install` to install rails gems;
* `rake db:seed` to populate the database;
* `rails s` to start the server.

It's done. Just access your localhost url.
